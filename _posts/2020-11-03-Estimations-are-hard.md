I took this class in college called Software Quality Assurance, the professor said something that has really stuck with me. 


"*Estimations are **easy**, good estimations are **hard**.*"


As engineers we may find outselves in a situation where the client is asking for an estimation.

You decide to come up with a quick estimate, it shows the client that you are ready for these type of questions and are confident in your abilities.

But this can inadvertently back you into a corner, if you were ill prepared to give this estimate you could have easily overlooked something that will add more time to your original estimate.

Now you either have to go into overdrive to makeup the difference or you need to renege on your estimate nullifying the benifits of providing that original estimate.


The authors of "The Pragmatic Programmer", Thomas and Hunt say there is another way...

Just say "*I'll get back to you.*"

So simple, yet so elegant.

You don't need to commit to something that you are not confident in, I would actually advise **against** it.

Take a little time, do some research, consult with your team, but most importantly build your confidence in your estimate!

Then when you are ready, come back to the client with a confident estimate. This will help you **avoid** being *hoisted by your own petard*.
