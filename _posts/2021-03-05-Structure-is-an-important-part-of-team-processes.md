## Structure is important

##### *In an uncertain world, one thing is certain, people are uncertain.*

Today as we were having our retrospective an issue was brought up. We were having trouble keeping from stepping on each others toes while working in the same area of code. 

As we discussed this issue and looked for a solution, we found that we were in need of a team touch-point when starting a story. I thought this was strange as we had already talked about this once before as a team. Even-more so, we already had a process in place in the form of a domain walkthrough.

When we first defined our domain walkthrough process, we all hated the idea of forcing everyone into a meeting that could have been done without them. We decided that we would make domain walkthroughs, not only optional, but double optional. If you didn't need one for you story, skip it; if you didn't think you could contribute to one, don't go.

We are not perfect, we get into a mid-week stride and suddenly a domain walkthrough is more hassle than what is is worth. A non-mandatory process slowly starts to fade from existence and like it was never there.

We had a way to prevent stepping on each others toes, a touch-point for those working in the same area, but it was lost to us. We didn't do it because we didn't have to and as a result, our toes got hurt.

Bureaucracy and red tape sucks, everyone hates it, but at the same time it is a necessity. A team process is either needed or not, there is no in-between, embrace it or trim the fat.
